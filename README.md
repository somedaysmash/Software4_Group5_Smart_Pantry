This project uses the Edamam API to get nutrition data and recipes for various foods. You need to have an app_id and an app_key for each API you want to use. You can get them by signing up for a free account at [ Edamam developer porta](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) and creating an application for the recipe API. You can also see your app_id and app_key in your Dashboard in the Applications section.

To use the Edamam API, you need to set the following variables in a file called API_key.py:

app_id = "xxxxxx"
app_key = "xxxxxxxxx"
